  Kim Jonghyun was celebrated for his <strong>crystalline, angelic voice</strong> â€“ a rare tenor that could convey 
  both powerhouse high notes (<em>Excuse Me Miss</em>) and fragile emotion (<em>End of a Day</em>). His artistry 
  inspired generations of idols, including <strong>ATEEZ's Jongho</strong> and <strong>(G)I-DLE's Miyeon</strong>, 
  who cite him as their reason for pursuing music. Beyond vocals, he pioneered mental health 
  advocacy in K-pop through raw lyrics (<em>Lonely</em>, <em>Let Me Out</em>) and his book <em>Skeleton Flower</em>. 
  Following his passing on December 18, 2017, over <strong>300 artists</strong> paid tribute, from 
  <strong>BTS's RM</strong> (covering <em>Breathe</em>) to <strong>IU</strong> (dedicating concerts to him). 
  His legacy persists through the <strong>Jonghyun Artist Grant</strong> and fans worldwide who 
  celebrate his birthday (April 8th) with <em>Shine On Jonghyun</em> projects.
